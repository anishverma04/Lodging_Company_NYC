# Lodging_Company_NYC

Problem Statement:  
A lodging company wants to know about different host & area?, learn from previous predictions(locations, prices), which hosts are busiest and why? And finally is there any noticeable difference of traffic among different areas and what could be the reason for it?

Approach :
I used exploratory data analysis and data visualization technique to solve and learn predictions. I used pie plot, histogram, scatter plot for finding different host & area and to find busiest host.  For finding traffic or density among different areas I used heat map. I used color map(scatter plot), box plot to predict relation between prices and location.
